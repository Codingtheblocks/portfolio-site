create an ordered step-by-step list in this folder C:\Users\jacob\Desktop\Jacob Mohan Portfolio\ai-specs for how youd implment this synthetic delta based options backtesting framework here C:\Users\jacob\Desktop\Jacob Mohan Portfolio\ai-specs\model-response.md. I want the step-by-step list to give full context and show all the required steps so I could hand it off to an AI LLM or developer and they could follow each step in order and have it fully functional options backtest engine in VectorBT.
