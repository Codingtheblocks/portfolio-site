I know the challenges of getting ORATS options data and I'm budget constrained. I'm in the design and test phase for a backtester. I want to add realistic options backtesting using synthetic delta based backtesting using the Black Sholes model and just the OHLC chart data. We can make this work for hypothetical returns for spread strategies e.g. selling an a .20 delta put should have roughly an 80% odds. I want to design this as a synthetic replacement for 0 DTE backtesting. Since we won't have intrabar prices or tick level prices for the options chain and spreads well create well instead use the OHLC or the high/low of the bars well use. My current framework and strategy backtester is VectorBT. Write an extensive requirements document on how we can simulate these spreads for backtesting in vectorbt and generate the simulated return EOD is fine. I want the step by step document and technical requirements document to serve as an extensive source so if I had it to an LLM it'll have our full context form this chat now and understand our requirements and the order to build it in.
