"A futuristic yet clean crypto trading dashboard UI on first launch. The layout is inspired by Raydium, GeckoTerminal, Gains.Trade, and TradeStation. The screen is structured with a clear modular wireframe:

Top Nav Bar: Full-width, dark glassmorphic style with logo on the left, theme toggle, user wallet status, and settings button on the right.

Left Sidebar: Vertical panel for the token watchlist with scrolling capability. Each row displays token symbol, price, 24h change, and volume with small sparkline charts.

Main Chart Area (center): Large real-time candlestick chart (like TradingView) with overlays and volume bars. Dropdown above for pair selection (e.g., ETH/USD). Indicator toggle bar above or side.

Right Sidebar: Strategy insights panel — showing active bots, PnL graph, trade history, and toggle between logs / orders / performance.

Bottom Panel (dock-style): Strategy builder with tabbed or card view layout. Includes dropdowns for selecting strategy type, indicator configs, inputs for stop-loss/take-profit, start/backtest buttons, and model training toggles if ML is used.

Color & Style: Dark background with neon glow accents (teal, violet, electric blue). 2xl rounded corners, soft shadows, crisp typography (Inter or Manrope). Floating tooltips and right-click context menus are visible on chart and strategy elements.

Overall Aesthetic: Clean, modular, data-heavy but uncluttered. Minimal animations, hover highlights, and card-based design. Everything resizable with panel drag controls."
